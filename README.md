# Markdown Blog

  This Blog will allow you to add an article, edit and delete it. It also comes with a markdown section so you can use *fancy syntax!*
  
  * things to add
     - User model, so the posts are tied to the user. As of now anyone can edit or delete anyone's post.
     - Could use some more css, would prefer this to be a dark theme blog.

If you want to clone this project, you will have to add your MongoDB connection string to a .env file ( mine is inside of the config folder, but you can have it anywhere, just point to it in your server.js file properly )
